Database README

This is an open source database. This is sort of a demonstration to prove that you don't need an overcomplicated interface for something like this.

I appreciate that most databases are now on web portals or something similar, but 

A: I am one of the three people left in the world who says that storing everything on the internet is stupid

B: It's designed to run on a Windows XP machine with processing power that would make someone from the Napoleonic war laugh

C: It's designed to run on a Windows XP machine with no internet connection.

Changelog:

        - [x] Downloaded DB browser for SQLite. Seems like it'll be useful
        
        - [x] Created demo file. Still doesn't work, but I'm getting there with the docs
        
        - [x] Demo file now works
        
        - [x] Added file type cheat sheet with python versions
        
        - [x] Added requriements file which isn't what it looks like. It's what the program is required to do. Should change
        
        - [x] I've got the structure and workflow clearer in my head (and on a napkin in the coffee shop I'm sat in)
        
        - [x] Added calendar.py to learn the calendar system
        
        - [x] deleted calendar.py and just started doing it in main.py
        
        - [x] I think I've broken it

        - [x] I made what should actually have been the requirements file and it's completely empty. Apparently this program doesn't require anything.

        - [x] why must I break everything I touch?

        - [x] Added License
        
        - [x] Created user input functionality

        - [x] Allow users to edit data in case they need to change something
        
        - [x] Change the case of certain inputs so it repairs capitalisation for them
        
        - [x] Make the date feature have some fancy datetime formatting

        - [x] Reformat to have a function (using code from Alex's fork)

        - [x] Fix the date feature so that it has the correct formatting because it's still broken as hell
        
        - [x] Datetime input sanitisation and better error handling

        - [x] Added rider weight and rider age inputs

To Do:
        
        - [ ] Add ability to edit and delete rows of data

        - [ ] Work out how I'm going to do the front end

        - [ ] Add horse weight and age inputs

        - [ ] Calculate if a rider and horse are compatable (possibly a front end feature)

        - [ ] Add hours worked so that horses can't be overworked
