Database README

This is an open source database. This is sort of a demonstration to prove that you don't need an overcomplicated interface for something like this.

I appreciate that most databases are now on web portals or something similar, but 

A: I am one of the three people left in the world who says that storing everything on the internet is stupid

B: It's designed to run on a Windows XP machine with processing power that would make someone from the Napoleonic war laugh

C: It's desinged to run on a Windows XP machine with no internet connection.

Changelog:

        Downloaded DB browser for SQLite. Seems like it'll be useful
        
        Created demo file. Still doesn't work, but I'm getting there with the docs
        
        Demo file now works
        
        Added file type cheat sheet with python versions
        
        Added requriements file which isn't what it looks like. It's what the program is required to do. Should change
        
        I've got the structure and workflow clearer in my head (and on a napkin in the coffee shop I'm sat in)
        
        Added calendar.py to learn the calendar system
        
        deleted calendar.py and just started doing it in main.py
        
        I think I've broken it

        I made what should actually have been the requirements file and it's completely empty. Apparently this program doesn't require anything.

        why must I break everything I touch?
